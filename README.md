# Aniemia-Screening-Project

## Introduction
Anemia is one of the most common health issues in third world countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly a quarter of the human population suffers from anemia.
The image of the eye is captured and the eye conjunctiva is automatically extracted from the image as a Region of Interest (ROI). The ROI is then processed and features are extracted from it to train a machine-learning algorithm to determine if the patient is anemic or not.
